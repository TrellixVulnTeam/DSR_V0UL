# Fundamentals of Machine Learning Course at DSR

Course by [Daniel Godoy](https://github.com/dvgodoy)

Original repo [here](https://github.com/dvgodoy/ML_Fundamentals)

You can use [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) to open the notebooks on an executable environment - just click on the badge: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dvgodoy/ML_Fundamentals/master)

After it starts, it will open a familiar ***Jupyter notebook interface***! Just run ***all cells***, wait for the ***interactive plots*** to load and you're good to go!
